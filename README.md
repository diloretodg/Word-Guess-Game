# Word-Guess-Game

This is my attempt at recreating the game "Hangman" with javascript code. I chose a simple theme with animals to keep things focused with plenty of two word names.

I feel like the greatest chalenge for me was the image display and my solution was to create an array of objects with different "src" to be replaced when a fuction was called to display that speific image with the related word. 

if i had more time i would have liked to turn things more object method structure and use returns and breaks to add efficiency.
